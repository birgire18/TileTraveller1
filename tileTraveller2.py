#First we create the file map from 1,1 to 3,3 by using numbers from 1 to 9 to name the tiles
#Then make possible moves for each tile
#Request the user for an input, wich should be a destination
#Respond to that input.(if it is not a valid input we let the user know then we re-request an input)
#If player reaches 3,1 (tile number 7) we print out "victory!", and then exit the program
